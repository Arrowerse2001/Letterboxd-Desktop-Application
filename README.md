# Letterboxd-Desktop-Application

# Plan for it.


This is a project of mine that I will develop within my free time. The idea is to basically make Letterboxd into a desktop application so you can run it through the pc instead of chrome (like spotify, you can use chrome or install it on PC). 



# Improvements Plan

- change the name to just LetterBox
- maybe even change the desktop icon
- like i said make it a setup so client's can change the location of installation and if they want a desktop shortcut
- maybe even remove the up and down bars

# How to Install (Installer coming soon)
Goto the ![releases](https://github.com/Arrowerse2001/Letterboxd-Desktop-Application/releases) section and download the .zip file named "Letterboxd-win32-ia32". Once downloaded locate the file in your download folder and unzip the file. Once unzipped locate the Letterboxd logo which is named Letterboxd and looks like ![this.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/563348190687002624/563367494895796224/Annotation_2019-04-04_151708.jpg) 




This will let you run and do everything you can do on Letterboxd. I would recommend you create a desktop shortcut so you don't need to search for the file everytime.
