# Letterboxd-Desktop-Application

# Plan for it.


This is a project of mine that I will develop within my free time. The idea is to basically make Letterboxd into a desktop application so you can run it through the pc instead of chrome (like spotify, you can use chrome or install it on PC). 



# Improvements Plan

- change the name to just LetterBox
- maybe even change the desktop icon
- like i said make it a setup so client's can change the location of installation and if they want a desktop shortcut
- maybe even remove the up and down bars
